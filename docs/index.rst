SVInsight
=========

**SVInsight** is a python package for calculating an exploratory social vulnerability index. This package calculates SVI using two methods: (1) an iterative factor analysis method and (2) a rank method, both of which have been heavily utilized in scholarly research. This package automates the creation and comparions of indices using U.S. American Community Survey 5-Year Data (ACS5) at the block group or tract level.
